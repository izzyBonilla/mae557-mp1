# mae557-mp1
Miniproject 1 for Fluid Dynamics

## Official Code Submission:
The entirety of the MP1 code is contianed by `burger.cpp` and `burger.hpp`. All other files are either bash machinery for compilation and plotting or experiments in re-implementing the code for efficiency and OOP-correctness. I've observed very strange behavior with the implicit solver (and it can be incredibly slow unfortunately); be cautious with long-time integration, as this can't capture shocks. In order to run the executable generated by `make submit`, you would write

`./burger.out <nx> <nt> <tf> <nu> <solver type>`

where `nx` is the number of spatial grid points, `nt` is the number of timesteps, `tf` is the final time, `nu` is the selected diffusion parameter, and `solver type` is an integer picking whether you want to use the explicit scheme (forward euler, upwinded 1st order finite difference) or the implicit scheme (backward euler, centered 2nd order finite difference).

Currently, the number of Newton iterations per timestep is fixed at 10; this number can easily be increased, but this will come at great computational cost. This code is highly unoptimized and naive, so if you feel like profiling this, I'm sure you will find tons of room for improvement.
